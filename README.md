# Passing Maps and Networks

---

I created these visualizations using the open data avaliable from Stats Bomb.
The 'passing_map.ipynb' is a notebook with the creating the passing map for Inter Milan in the first half 
of the 2010 UEFA Champions League. 

I used mplsoccer, matplot, pandas, numpy, and requests libaries to build this visualization. 

Let me know what you think!
